# SCUMLauncher
Server browser for scum, meant to autosubscribe to any Workshop items in version 1.0 of the game


Needs to be refined, needs to have a proper filter list. etc. 
extreme Work in progress as I have not solved the webscraping issue for finding servers. 
(I do not know if theres an API for the game to grab the servers from their public list)

Will be compiled into an EXE eventually. 

Clicking on a server would bring up a informations screen showing playercount. Mods. Time. etc. 
There will be a launch game option launching into the selected server after downloading the appropriate mods. 
If there is discord tied to the server info. it should populate a discord join link that the user can click on.
